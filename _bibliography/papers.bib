  abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) promises to enhance daily office activities involving numerous textual documents, slides, and spreadsheets by expanding workspaces and enabling more direct interaction. However, there is a lack of systematic understanding of how knowledge workers can manage multiple documents and organize, explore, and compare them in AR environments. Therefore, we conducted a user-centered design study (N = 21) using predefined spatial document layouts in AR to elicit interaction techniques, resulting in 790 observation notes. Thematic analysis identified various interaction methods for aggregating, distributing, transforming, inspecting, and navigating document collections. Based on these findings, we propose a design space and distill design implications for AR document arrangement systems, such as enabling body-anchored storage, facilitating layout spreading and compressing, and designing interactions for layout transformation. To demonstrate their usage, we developed a rapid prototyping system and exemplify three envisioned scenarios. With this, we aim to inspire the design of future immersive offices.},

  abstract = {This position paper addresses the fallacies associated with the im- proper use of affordances in the opportunistic design of augmented reality (AR) applications. While opportunistic design leverages existing physical affordances for content placement and for creat- ing tangible feedback in AR environments, their misuse can lead to confusion, errors, and poor user experiences. The paper em- phasizes the importance of perceptible affordances and properly mapping virtual controls to appropriate physical features in AR applications by critically reflecting on four fallacies of facilitating affordances, namely, the subjectiveness of affordances, affordance imposition and reappropriation, properties and dynamicity of en- vironments, and mimicking the real world. By highlighting these potential pitfalls and proposing a possible path forward, we aim to raise awareness and encourage more deliberate and thoughtful use of affordances in the design of AR applications.},

  abstract = {In recent years, data-driven stories have found a firm footing in journalism, business, and education. They leverage visualization and storytelling to convey information to broader audiences. Likewise, immersive technologies, like augmented and virtual reality devices, provide excellent potential for exploring and explaining data, thus inviting research on how data-driven storytelling transfers to immersive environments. To gain a better understanding of this exciting novel research area, we conducted a scoping review on the emerging notion of immersive data-driven storytelling, extended by surveying immersive data journalism and by analyzing immersive games, selected based on community reviews and tags. We present our methodology for the survey and discuss prominent themes that coalesce the knowledge we extracted from the literature, journalism, and games. These themes include, among others, the spatial embodiment of narration, the incorporation of the users and their context into narratives, and the balance between guiding the user versus promoting serendipity. Our discussion of these themes reveals research opportunities and challenges that will inform the design of immersive data-driven stories in the future.},

Immersive technolo- gies like virtual reality (VR) have great potential for presenting en- gaging narratives and multimodal content in innovative ways. How- ever, it is essential to ensure that the presentation and interaction possibilities are comprehensible to broad audiences. Drawing in- spiration from the traditional role of books in preserving stories, we introduce StoryBook, a conceptual metaphor for interacting with and unfolding immersive data stories. Through analogical reason- ing, we mapped existing concepts of physical books to interact with a VR storytelling process. StoryBook provides a familiar and intu- itive way of navigating, inserting, and extracting story elements in VR, akin to page-flipping, bookmarking, or note-taking with a real book. We developed a prototype and conducted initial user feed- back sessions, showcasing the potential of our concepts.

However, to fully leverage the spatial capabilities of MR technology, a better understanding of how and where to place virtual content like documents is required, particularly considering the situated context. I aim to explore spatial organization strategies for virtual content in MR environments. For that, we conducted empirical studies investigating users' strategies for document layout and placement and examined two real-world factors: physical environments and people present. With this knowledge, we proposed a mixed-reality approach for the in-situ exploration and analysis of human movement data utilizing physical objects in the original space as referents. My next steps include exploring arrangement strategies, designing techniques empowering spatial organization, and extending understandings for multi-user scenarios. My dissertation will enrich the immersive interface repertoire and contribute to the design of future MR systems.},

As the physical environment shapes human motion and behavior, the analysis of such motion can benefit from the direct inclusion of the environment in the analytical process. We present methods for exploring movement data in relation to surrounding regions of interest, such as objects, furniture, and architectural elements. We introduce concepts for selecting and filtering data through direct interaction with the environment, and a suite of visualizations for revealing aggregated and emergent spatial and temporal relations. More sophisticated analysis is supported through complex queries comprising multiple regions of interest. To illustrate the potential of Pearl, we developed an Augmented Reality-based prototype and conducted expert review sessions and scenario walkthroughs in a simulated exhibition. Our contribution lays the foundation for leveraging the physical environment in the in-situ analysis of movement data.},

abstract = {Mixed Reality (MR) popularizes numerous situated applications where virtual content is spatially integrated into our physical environment. However, we only know little about what properties of an environment influence the way how people place digital content and perceive the resulting layout. We thus conducted a preliminary study (N = 8) examining how physical surfaces affect organizing virtual content like documents or charts, focusing on user perception and experience. We found, among others, that the situated layout of virtual content in its environment can be characterized by the level of spatial as well as semantic coupling. Consequently, we propose a two-dimensional design space to establish the vocabularies and detail their parameters for content organization. With our work, we aim to facilitate communication between designers or researchers, inform general MR interface design, and provide a first step towards future MR workspaces empowered by blending digital content and its real-world context.},

However, it is unclear how physical surroundings and co-located collaboration influence the spatial organization of virtual content for sensemaking. Therefore, we conducted a study (N=28) to investigate the effect of office environments and work styles during a document classification task using AR with regard to content placement, layout strategies, and sensemaking workflows. Results show that participants require furniture, especially tables and whiteboards, to assist sensemaking and collaboration regardless of room settings, while generous free spaces (e.g., walls) are likely used when available. Moreover, collaborating participants tend to use furniture despite personal layout preferences. We identified different placement and layout strategies, as well as the transitions in-between. Finally, we propose design implications for future immersive sensemaking applications and beyond.},

Collective activities like brainstorming and sensemaking often use space for arranging documents and information and thus will likely benefit from AR-enhanced offices. Until now, there has been very little research on how the physical surroundings might affect virtual content placement for collaborative sensemaking. We therefore conducted an initial study with eight participants in which we compared two different room settings for collaborative image categorization regarding content placement, spatiality, and layout. We found that participants tend to utilize the room’s vertical surfaces as well as the room’s furniture, particularly through edges and gaps, for placement and organization. We also identified three different spatial layout patterns (panoramic-strip, semi-cylindrical layout, furniture-based distribution) and observed the usage of temporary storage spaces specifically for collaboration.},

Our goal is to address the lack of immersion and intuitive input of conventional systems by providing spatial navigation to extract arbitrary slices from volumetric data directly in three-dimensional space. A 3D model of the medical data is displayed in the real environment, fixed to a particular location, using AR. The tablet is spatially moved through this virtual 3D model and shows the resulting slices as 2D images. We present several techniques that facilitate this overall concept, e.g., to place and explore the model, as well as to capture, annotate, and compare slices of the data. Furthermore, we implemented a proof-of-concept prototype that demonstrates the feasibility of our concepts. With our work we want to improve the current way of working with volumetric data slices in the medical domain and beyond.}

However, authoring such visualizations still heavily relies on traditional, stationary desktop setups, which inevitably separates users from the actual working space. To better support the authoring process in immersive environments, we propose the integration of spatially-aware mobile devices. Such devices also enable precise touch interaction for data configuration while lowering the entry barriers of novel immersive technologies. We therefore contribute an initial set of concepts within a scenario for authoring AR visualizations. We implemented an early prototype for configuring visualizations in-situ on the mobile device without programming and report our first impressions.},

We present an extended visualization authoring model for Post-WIMP interfaces, which support designers by a more seamless approach of developing and utilizing visualizations.

However, traditional online shops often have a narrow bandwidth for product visualizations and interactive techniques and lack a compelling shopping context. In this paper, we report a study on eliciting user-defined gestures for shopping tasks in an immersive VR (virtual reality) environment. We made a methodological contribution by providing a varied practice for producing more usable freehand gestures than traditional elicitation studies. Using our method, we developed a gesture taxonomy and generated a user-defined gesture set. To validate the usability of the derived gesture set, we conducted a comparative study and answered questions related to the performance, error count, user preference and effort required from end-users to use freehand gestures compared with traditional immersive VR interaction techniques, such as the virtual handle controller and ray-casting techniques. Experimental results show that the freehand-gesture-based interaction technique was rated to be the best in terms of task load, user experience, and presence without the loss of performance (i.e., speed and error count). Based on our findings, we also developed several design guidelines for gestural interaction.}
